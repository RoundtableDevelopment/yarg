Yet Another Rails Generator
===========================

## Description

This is just a starting point for a functional Rails app.  This was borne out of the need for consistency and speed when spinning up new projects.

## Requirements

This template currently depends on you having the following:
- Ruby 2.x
- Rails 5.2.x
- PostgreSQL
- Redis

## Running the Generator

Run with the following command:
```
rails new myapp -T -d postgresql -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoundtableDevelopment/yarg/master/template.rb
```

## Inspiration and Thanks

Much of the code and design in this repository was borrowed from the work of others.  Big thanks to the originators of those projects.  Here are some existing app generators that had a significant impact on this work:
